Cid has set a transport business at the town of Poft with his airship, using the money charged for the flights to maintain it. During Firion and his allies' quest to destroy the Dreadnought, Cid tells Firion that airships are powered by Sunfire, and that a lack of control of it would cause any engine to explode. After Firion and his friends obtain the Sunfire at Kashuan, Cid and Princess Hilda attempt to meet them there, but Cid's airship is captured by the Dreadnought itself. The rebels succeed in infiltrating the Dreadnought and rescuing both Cid and Princess Hilda and destroy the warship.\r\n\r\nLater, Cid is fatally injured during the onslaught of the Emperor's Cyclone, and is taken to Paul's home in Fynn. After the Cyclone is destroyed, he summons Firion to his bedside and gives him the airship, which Firion uses to enter Palamecia Castle to stop Leon.\r\n\r\nHowever, Cid's soul travels to Machanon with other people who have perished fighting the Empire. Cid joins the fallen white knights of Fynn to aid the perished civilians escape the monster-filled Raqia caverns and set up a small town beyond the passage inside. When Minwu, Scott, Ricard and Josef leave Raqia, they arrive at Machanon as well, and meet Cid, who also offers them advice on their quest.",

Although it is the final boss, it does not appear until the very end. Its goal is to cause a flood of darkness to reduce the world to nothingness. In Final Fantasy III, the Cloud of Darkness appears as a green-skinned female humanoid emerging from a portal of darkness at its waist. It has a red heart-shaped mark on its forehead, and several mouthed tentacles around it. In Yoshitaka Amano's concept art of it and in Dissidia Final Fantasy, the Cloud of Darkness takes the form of a shapely woman wearing a red and black cape with the rest of its body covered in red and black markings. It has the red heart-shaped mark on its forehead, and has long silver hair. It has only two tentacles, emerging from its waist. The Cloud of Darkness is the tallest non-giant character in the Dissidia series. Though the Cloud of Darkness universally takes on a feminine form, it is officially considered a genderless being that merely chooses to appear as such. The Cloud of Darkness refers to itself in the plural, using \"We\" instead of \"I\". Dissidia Final Fantasy explains this as its two tentacles having minds of their own, and the humanoid body speaking for the three of them.",

The only way to remove the curse is for the Djinn to be sealed in the Mythril Ring, which Princess Sara sets out to do. Djinn is resistant to the ring's effect, and it takes the Warriors of the Light to weaken him enough to be banished. Djinn primarily uses strong melee attacks with his scimitar and Fire magic. The Djinn generally can do around 30 damage with his scimitar and 20 when Fire is cast on all characters. He is weak against Water and Ice spells and items; players should use Blizzard, s, and/or Antarctic Winds, but regular attacks will also suffice.",

In reality, he is one of several monsters sent by Xande to cause chaos on the Floating Continent, and his true form is that of a skeletal being. He casts a spell over the Elder Tree, causing it to float over the desert south of Castle Argus, and christens it Castle Hein.\n\nHein bewitches the castle's inhabitants and imprisons them in his new fortress, where he terrorizes the neighboring town of Tokkul. Luneth and his friends are captured during a raid and are brought to the living castle. They overcome the guards and monsters and ascend the decaying tree to face Hein, who shows no remorse for his actions. The Warriors of Light defeat the crazed mage, and the Elder Tree returns to its true form. Before replanting itself in the forest from whence it came, the tree restores the royal family and guards of Argus to their rightful place at the throne. ",

He trained and gave each of them a gift: mortality to Xande, vast knowledge of magic to Doga, and absolute control of the dream world to Unei. His fate after this is unknown, but an Evoker in Replito mentions his demise offhand. Noah was responsible for the sealing of Leviathan and Bahamut on the Floating Continent, it is also stated that he was able to summon them both. He could not only use both white and black magic, but he could also use summoning magic. The Magus is referenced several times through items and abilities: Noah's Lute is an item used in the game to awaken Unei from her sleep, and the song used by Bards in the game is called \"Lute of Noah\".",

However, Sara left of her own volition to break his curse. Her first attempt to seal the Djinn with the Mythril Ring fails, so the party must weaken him in battle before it works. After the Djinn is killed, she throws her ring into the spring in the castle basement, dispelling the curse and remaining in Castle Sasune while the party continues with their adventure. The 3D remake adds a Mognet sidequest. Sara writes to Ingus throughout the game, and her final letter is a request to fix her broken pendant, which leads the party to meet the Legendary Smith. Whenever the party meets Sara, she shows interest in Ingus. While he has sworn to protect her, he returns the interest. When Doga asks Sara to help break the Curse of the five wyrms, she joins him once she finds out Ingus is in trouble. After breaking the curse, she stays behind with the others while the party enters the World of Darkness. When the Cloud of Darkness is defeated, Sara decides to stay with Ingus for a while, before returning to the castle.",

Xande has white hair and dark blue skin with bright yellow eyes. He appears with great muscle mass shown by his exposed upper body, he wears a white cape (blue in the NES version), orange pants, an orange and blue sash wrapped around his waist with what appears to be a cat-shaped buckle at the top-center of it, and brown boots. Master Xande was originally one of Great Magus Noah's students, along with Master Doga and Master Unei. Both Master Doga and Master Unei were given great magical powers. Master Xande was given a much stranger gift, the gift of mortality. Master Xande was driven mad by the thought of dying. In a blind rage, Master Xande sought to disrupt the balance of light and darkness, by draining the crystals of their power. By doing so, the world would be flooded in darkness, and time would freeze. Thus, he would no longer have to fear death.",

She is the top general and most trusted warrior of the all-female army of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nBeatrix is a proud, merciless and threatening soldier, respected and feared among warriors all around the world as the finest of them all. She does not like to take a back seat to anyone, especially Kuja and his black mages, and initially views Captain Adelbert Steiner of the Knights of Pluto as a rival. While loyal to Queen Brahne, her first priority is protecting the citizens of Alexandria. Beatrix acts stoic towards her enemies, but has a kind heart, willingness to forgive, and is soft-spoken and polite to her allies.\r\n\r\nBeatrix is fought as a boss on a few occasions. As a playable character, her abilities are Seiken and Wht Mag. Seiken grants her offensive damaging abilities with her sword similar to Steiner's Swd Art (the skillsets also share some abilities), while she has access to several white magic spells for curative purposes. Beatrix wields the Save the Queen sword in battle, and wears heavy armor.",

Initially introduced as an antagonist, he has made a number of appearances in remakes and later titles. To date, Gilgamesh has had more appearances in any Final Fantasy media than any other character, and may be the only character to appear in more than one game in the main series (see below). Gilgamesh began a tradition of an incompetent, comical, yet persistent recurring boss for the player to face.\n\nGilgamesh's role has varied greatly from ally, to enemy, to summon, but for most of his appearances he is a traveling sword collector who battles with a variety of rare and powerful weapons. In most, if not all, of his appearances, Gilgamesh is searching for the legendary sword, Excalibur, but often ends up with the imitation known as Excalipoor. Another of Gilgamesh's trademarks is Genji equipment, which can be stolen from or dropped by him.\n\nOriginally voiced in Japan by Daisuke Gōri for the Japanese release of Final Fantasy XII before his death on January 17th, 2010, Gilgamesh's voice is provided by Kazuya Nakai as of Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, by Riki Kitazawa in Final Fantasy XIV, by Kazuya Nakai once more in World of Final Fantasy, and by Kazuhiko Inoue in Final Fantasy XV. In the English versions, Gilgamesh is voiced by John DiMaggio in Final Fantasy XII, Keith Szarabajka in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Type-0 HD, Kurt Wilson in Final Fantasy XIV and Tom Taylorson in Final Fantasy XV.",

The prototype to the Magitek Knights, Kefka acts as Emperor Gestahl's court mage carrying out his orders, but behind his back schemes for his own ends. While previous antagonists in the Final Fantasy series were distant, cold, ruthless, and bent on their goals, Kefka is loud, short-tempered, maniacal, and destructive. His popularity among Final Fantasy fans, at least outside Japan, as an antagonist is rivaled only by Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII. Kefka is known for his many one-liners, his final almighty appearance (which has become something of a tradition in the series), as well as his sociopathic hatred of everything in existence. Kefka's defining character trait is his laughter, a high-pitched whooping cackle. In large part because of his dark humor and jester attire, Kefka was also given the nickname ''the psycho clown'' by fans, with this eventually becoming official with his CollectaCard description in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.",

She is often considered the game's central protagonist, which would make her the first female protagonist in the mainstream Final Fantasy series.",

More details of her became available in Dirge of Cerberus -Final Fantasy VII-, such as her surname, her birthday (July 22), and her bloodtype (B).\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese versions of Final Fantasy VII she is referred to as ルクレッツィア (Rukurettsia?) in Lucrecia's Cave and its associated flashbacks, however when Vincent speaks of her in Nibelheim and in all instances outside of the game she is referred to with the kana given at the beginning of this article.",

Marlene is the daughter of Barret's friends Dyne and Eleanor. Barret had taken Marlene in as his own daughter after his friend Dyne, his hometown Corel, and loved ones were destroyed by Shinra troops. As Marlene was less than a year old when her town was burned to the ground and her mother was killed, she has no memory of her biological parents.\r\n\r\nIn the game's storyline Marlene is four years old. She takes it upon herself to care for Tifa Lockhart's 7th Heaven bar when Tifa joins Cloud Strife and Barret on an AVALANCHE mission. Later, Shinra destroys Sector 7 and Aeris Gainsborough takes Marlene to safety while the AVALANCHE fights to defend the pillar that supports the plate above. Shinra follow her and Aeris gives herself to the Turks in exchange for Marlene's safety. During this time, Aeris asked Marlene questions regarding Cloud's personality, suggesting she had developed a crush on him.\r\n\r\nMarlene is then left with Elmyra, Aeris's adoptive mother, and is later held hostage by the Shinra spy Cait Sith to force Cloud to cooperate with him on their journey to the Temple of the Ancients. She later receives the news of Aeris's death at Sephiroth's hands by Reeve. Marlene appears one last time at the end of the game, sensing Aeris's presence just before the Lifestream emerges to aid in the conflict between Holy and Meteor.\r\n",

Unsatisfied with his job, and disillusioned with the company he works for, he does not so much as question the identity of Cloud's group when they enter his office on the 62nd floor of Shinra Headquarters.\r\n\r\nHe offers Cloud the chance to guess the word he is thinking to get his keycard, a puzzle solvable with clues found in the library. If the player guesses correctly on the first try, Domino gives an Elemental Materia along with the keycard. If the player guesses the password on the second try, they get an Elixir, on the third time they get an Ether, on the fourth try a Potion, and if it takes more than four guesses to get the password, the player gets no item reward, just the keycard. In the English and Japanese versions one of four passwords is randomly chosen each game, although ORBS and HOJO are never the correct answer. In other localizations, MAKO is always the correct answer.",
